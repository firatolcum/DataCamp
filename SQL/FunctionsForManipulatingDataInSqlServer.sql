----------------------------------FUNCTIONS FOR MANIPULATING DATA IN SQL SERVER--------------------------------------------------------

--1. CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE DATA TYPE--------------------------------------------------------
--Categories of Data Types:
  --A. Exact numerics
	--> Stores the literal representation of the number's value.
	--A.1 Whole Numbers:
		 --Smallint >> 2 Bytes
		 --tinyint  >> 1 Byte
		 --int		>> 4 Bytes
		 --bigint	>> 8 Bytes
	--A.2 Decimal Numbers:
		 --Numeric, decimal, money, smallmoney
		 --Precision      --Storage
		 --1-9				5 Bytes	
		 --10-19			9 Bytes
		 --20-28			13 Bytes
		 --29-38			17 Bytes
		 --Precision is an integer representing the total number of digits a number can have.

  --B. Approximate numerics
	   --Float
	   --Real
	   --> Float and Real store approximate numeric values.
	   --> You should use these types carefully and avýid using them in WHERE clause with an equality operator.
	   
  --C. Date and time
	   --Data type			--Format						--Accuracy
	   --time				  hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn]			  100 nanoseconds
	   --date				  YYY-MM-DD						  1 day
	   --smalldatetime		  YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss			  1 minute
	   --datetime			  YYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnn]		  0.00333 second
	   --datetime2			  YYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.nnnnnnn]	  100 nanoseconds

  --D. Character strings
	   --> Charcter data types store character strings(ASCII).
	   --> ASCII types are used to store strings with English characters.
	   --Char
	   --Varchar
	   --Text

  --E. Unicode character strings
	   --> Unicode data types are used for storing Unicode data(non-ASCII).
	   --> With Unicode types, you can store characters from all languages around the world(like Japanese).
	   --Nchar
	   --Nvarchar
	   --Ntext
 
  --F. Other data types
	   --Binary, image, cursor, rowversion, uniqueidentifier, xml, spatial geometry / geography types


--Example-1
--Add a new column with the correct data type, for storing the last date a person voted ("2018-01-17").
ALTER TABLE voters
ADD last_vote_date DATE;

--Add a new column called last_vote_time, to keep track of the most recent time when a person voted ("16:55:00").
ALTER TABLE voters
ADD last_vote_time TIME;

--Add a new column,last_login, storing the most recent time a person accessed the application ("2019-02-02 13:44:00").
ALTER TABLE voters
ADD last_login DATETIME2;


--NOTE-1 : 
	-- Keep in mind: For comparing two values, they need to be of the same type. Otherwise:
		--1. SQL Server converts from one type to another(IMPLICIT). Performed automatically, behind the scenes.
		--2. The developer explicitly converts the data(EXPLICIT). Performed with the functions CAST() and CONVERT().
	-- Data Type Precedence:
		--1. User-defined data types(highest)
		--2. datetime
		--3. date
		--4. float
		--5. decimal
		--6. int
		--7. bit
		--8. nvarchar
		--9. varchar
		--10 binary(lowest)

--Implicit Conversion Example-1 :
SELECT 
	company,
	bean_type,
	cocoa_percent
FROM
	ratings
WHERE
	cocoa_percent > '0.5'

--Implicit Conversion Example-2 :

SELECT 
	company,
	bean_type,
	cocoa_percent
FROM
	ratings
WHERE
	cocoa_percent > GETDATE()


--Explicit Conversion Example-1 :

SELECT 
	CAST(3.14 AS INT) AS DECIMAL_TO_INT,
	CAST('3.14' AS DECIMAL(3, 2)) AS STRING_TO_DECIMAL,
	CAST(GETDATE() AS NVARCHAR(20)) AS DATE_TO_STRING,
	CAST(GETDATE() AS FLOAT) AS DATE_TO_FLOAT


SELECT 
	CONVERT(INT, 3.14) AS DECIMAL_TO_INT,
	CONVERT(DECIMAL(3,2), '3.14') STRING_TO_DECIMAL,
	CONVERT(NVARCHAR(20), GETDATE(), 104) AS DATE_TO_STRING,--The number 104 is a code for date format.
	CONVERT(FLOAT, GETDATE()) AS DATE_TO_FLOAT

--CAST() vs. CONVERT():
  --1. CAST() comes from the SQL standart and CONVERT() is SQL Server specific.
  --2. CAST() is available in most database products.
  --3. CONVERT() performs slightly better in SQL Server.


--Explicit Conversion Example-2 :
SELECT 
	-- Transform the year part from the birthdate to a string
	first_name + ' ' + last_name + ' was born in ' + CAST(YEAR(birthdate) AS nvarchar) + '.' 
FROM voters;


--Explicit Conversion Example-3 :
SELECT 
	-- Transform to int the division of total_votes to 5.5
	CAST(total_votes / 5.5 AS INT) AS DividedVotes
FROM voters;


--Explicit Conversion Example-4 :
SELECT 
	first_name,
	last_name,
	total_votes
FROM voters
-- Transform the total_votes to char of length 10
WHERE CAST(total_votes AS VARCHAR(10)) LIKE '5%';


--Explicit Conversion Example-5 :
SELECT 
	email,
    -- Convert birthdate to varchar show it like: "Mon dd,yyyy" 
    CONVERT(VARCHAR, birthdate, 107) AS birthdate
FROM voters;


--Explicit Conversion Example-6 :
SELECT 
	company,
    bean_origin,
    -- Convert the rating column to an integer
    CONVERT(INT,rating) AS rating
FROM ratings;


--Explicit Conversion Example-7 :
SELECT 
	company,
    bean_origin,
    rating
FROM ratings
-- Convert the rating to an integer before comparison
WHERE CONVERT(INT, rating) = 3;


--Explicit Conversion Example-8 :
SELECT 
	first_name,
    last_name,
	-- Convert birthdate to varchar(10) and show it as yy/mm/dd. This format corresponds to value 11 of the "style" parameter.
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), birthdate, 11) AS birthdate,
    gender,
    country
FROM voters
WHERE country = 'Belgium' 
    -- Select only the female voters
	AND gender = 'F'
    -- Select only people who voted more than 20 times  
    AND total_votes > 20;


--Explicit Conversion Example-9 :
SELECT
	first_name,
    last_name,
	-- Convert birthdate to varchar(10) to show it as yy/mm/dd
	CONVERT(varchar(10), birthdate, 11) AS birthdate,
    gender,
    country,
    -- Convert the total_votes number to nvarchar
    'Voted ' + CAST(total_votes AS NVARCHAR(10)) + ' times.' AS comments
FROM voters
WHERE country = 'Belgium'
    -- Select only the female voters
	AND gender = 'F'
    -- Select only people who voted more than 20 times
    AND total_votes > 20;



--2. MANIPULATING TIME--------------------------------------------------------
     --Common mistakes when working with dates and time:
	   --> Inconsistent date time formats or patterns.
	   --> Arithmetic operations.
	   --> Issues with time zones.

	 --Time zones in SQL Server:
	   --> Local time zone
	   --> UTC time zone(Universal Time Coordinate)

	 --Functions that return the date and time of the operating system:
	   --1. Higher-precision functions:
			--SYSDATETIME(): Returns the computer's date and time, without timezone information.
			--SYSUTCDATETIME(): Returns the computer's date and time as UTC.
			--SYSDATETIMEOFFSET(): Returns the computer's date and time, together with timezone offset.

	   --2. Lower-precision functions:
			--GETDATE(): Returns the current date.
			--GETUTCDATE(): Returns the current date as UTC.
			--CURRENT_TIMESTAMP: Equivalent with GETDATE(), the only difference CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is called without the parantheses.
	
	 --Functions returning date and time parts:
	   -- YEAR(): Returns the year from the specified date.
	   -- MONTH(): Returns the month from the specified date.
	   -- DAY(): Returns the day part from a given date.
	   -- DATENAME(): Returns a character string representing the specified date part of the given date.
	   -- DATEPART(): This works in the same way as DATENAME(), the difference being that the returned values are all integers.
	   -- DATEFROMPARTS(): Receives 3 parameters(year, month, day) and the function generates a date.

	 --Performing arithmetic operations on dates:
	   --Operations using arithmetic operators(+, -):
		 --> Performing arithmetic opreations directly on two dates or between a date and a number is possible in SQL Server.
	   --DATEADD(): With DATEADD(), you add a date part to a date and the result wil be a new date.
	   --DATEDIFF(): With DATEADD(), you can find the difference in time units between two dates.

	 --Validating if an expression is a date:
	   --ISDATE(): Determines whether an expression is a valid date data type.Accepts one parameter.
		 --ISDATE() expression    --Return type
		 --date, time, datetime	    1
		 --datetime2				0
		 --other type				0
	 --There are functions that can impact the output of ISDATE().
	   --SET DATEFORMAT {format}
			--> Set the order of the date parts for interpretig strings as dates.
			--> Valid formats: mdy, dmy, ymd, ydm, myd, dym.
	   --SET LANGUAGE {language}
			--> Sets the language for the session.
			--> Implicitly sets the setting of SET DATEFORMAT.
			--> Valid languages: English, Italian, Spanish, etc.


--High-precision functions example:
SELECT 
	SYSDATETIME() AS [SYSDATETIME],
	SYSDATETIMEOFFSET() AS [SYSDATETIMEOFFSET],
	SYSUTCDATETIME() AS [SYSUTCDATETIME]


--Low-precision functions example:
SELECT
	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP],
	GETUTCDATE() AS [GETUTCDATE]

--Retrieving only the date:
SELECT
	CONVERT(DATE, SYSDATETIME()) AS [SYSDATETIME],
	CONVERT(DATE, SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()) AS [SYSDATETIMEOFFSET],
	CONVERT(DATE, SYSUTCDATETIME()) AS [SYSUTCDATETIME],
	CONVERT(DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP],
	CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE()) AS [GETDATE],
	CONVERT(DATE, GETUTCDATE()) AS [GETUTCDATE]

--Retrieving only the time:
SELECT
	CONVERT(TIME, SYSDATETIME()) AS [SYSDATETIME],
	CONVERT(TIME, SYSDATETIMEOFFSET()) AS [SYSDATETIMEOFFSET],
	CONVERT(TIME, SYSUTCDATETIME()) AS [SYSUTCDATETIME],
	CONVERT(TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP],
	CONVERT(TIME, GETDATE()) AS [GETDATE],
	CONVERT(TIME, GETUTCDATE()) AS [GETUTCDATE]

--Example-3------------------------
--Select the current date in UTC time (Universal Time Coordinate) using two different functions.
SELECT
	SYSUTCDATETIME() AS UTC_HighPrecision,
	GETUTCDATE() AS UTC_LowPrecision


--Example-4------------------------
--Select the local system's date, including the timezone information.
SELECT SYSDATETIMEOFFSET() AS Timezone


--Example-4------------------------
--Use two functions to query the system's local date, without timezone information. Show the dates in different formats.
SELECT
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(24), SYSDATETIME(), 107) AS HighPrecision,
	CONVERT(VARCHAR(24), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 102) AS LowPrecision

--3. WORKING WITH STRINGS--------------------------------------------------------

--A. Functions for positions:
  --1. LEN(): 
	--> Returns the number of characters of the provided string excluding the blanks at the end.
	--> It has only one parameter:the string whose length you want to calculate.
  --2. CHARINDEX()
	--> Looks for a character expression in a given string.
	--> Returns its starting position.
	--> It has 2 mandatory parameters and 1 optional parameter:
		--the expression we are looking for, the string in which we do the search, a value expressing the starting position of te search.
  --3. PATINDEX()
	--> It is similar to CHARINDEX() but more powerful.
	--> Returns the starting position of a pattern in an expression.
	--> You can use wildcard characters in the expression you are looking for.
		--Wildcard:		Explanation:
		--%				Match any string of any length(including zero length).
		--_				Match on a single character.
		--[]			Match on any character in the [] brackets(for example [abc] would match on a, b or c characters).

--B. Functions for string transformation:
  --1. LOWER():
	--> Converts all characters from a string to lowercase.
  --2. UPPER():
	--> Converts all characters from a string to uppercase.
  --3. LEFT():
	--> Returns the specified number of characters from the beginning of the string.
	--> Receive 2 parameters.The string you are working with and the number of characters you need from it.
  --4. RIGHT():
	--> Returns the specified number of characters from the end of the string.
	--> Receive 2 parameters.The string you are working with and the number of characters you need from it.
  --5. LTRIM():
	--> Returns a string after removing the leading blanks.
  --6. RTRIM():
	--> Returns a string after removing the trailing blanks.
  --7. TRIM():
	--> Returns a string after removing the blanks or other specified characters.
  --8. REPLACE():
	--> Returns a string where all occurences of an expression are replaced with another one.
	--> Receive 3 parameters:
		--The expression in which we are performing the search, the expression we are searching for, and then the replacement.
  --9. SUBSTRING():
	--> Returns part of a string.
	--> This function needs 3 parameters:
		--The expression from which you want to extract substring, starting position of your substring and number of characters you want to return.

--C. Functions manipulating groups of strings:
  --1. CONCAT():
	--> You can concatenate a series of strings using CONCAT().
	--> CONCAT() joins values together.
  --2. CONCAT_WS():
	--> You can concatenate a series of strings using CONCAT_WS().
	--> CONCAT_WS(), meaning concat with seperator.
	--> Receives a character value as the first parameter, which is called 'the seperator'.
	--Keep in mind:
		/* The advantage of using functions instead of joining together values with the '+' operator is that 
		   you can concatenate all data types, not only strings. */
  --3. STRING_AGG():
	--> Concatenates the values of string expressions and places seperator values between them.
	--> It also has an optional clause. STRING_AGG(expression, seperator) [<order_clause>]
  --4.STRING_SPLIT(string, seperator):
	--> Divides a string into smaller pieces, based on a sperator.
	--> Returns a single column table.
	--> Because the result of the function is a table, it cannot be used as a column in the SELECT clause.
	--> You can only use it in the FROM clause, just like a normal table.
